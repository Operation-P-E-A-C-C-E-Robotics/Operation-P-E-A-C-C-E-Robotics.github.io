Stretch is a 6-Wheel tank drive robot that works around a huge arm on a turret, the arm has 5 degrees of freedom and has a claw at the end that can pick up both the cones and the cubes (the game pieces for this year)\
\
The robot got it's name "Stretch" because of how far and how many different ways it can *stretch* its arm around.  The design was also quite a stretch to pull off, requiring lots of custom machining and special parts.
