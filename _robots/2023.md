    summary: >
      AGR is our closest sponsor. In 2015, our team stayed at several different
      locations as we struggled to find somewhere permanent, eventually, we
      found the Arthur G. Russell Company. AGR allows us to use their loft that
      overlooks the factory floor. They have supported us in several different
      ways, such as allowing us to use their machinery on the shop floor and
      having access to many tools and parts, providing us with financial aid
      annually, featuring us at their holiday luncheons, and with employee
      mentors who are willing to help our team grow and learn.

Stretch is a 6-Wheel tank drive robot that works around a huge arm on a turret, the arm has 5 degrees of freedom and has a claw at the end that can pick up both the cones and the cubes (the game pieces for this year)\
\
The robot got it's name "Stretch" because of how far and how many different ways it can *stretch* its arm around.  The design was also quite a stretch to pull off, requiring lots of custom machining and special parts.
