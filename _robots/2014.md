For the 2014 game "Aerial Assist", our team presents "Chuck". Chuck is a small robot that can pick up large yoga balls, and throw them using the catapult in the middle of the robot.

Chuck won the Quality Award at the Pine Tree District Event.

In 2022, Chuck was refit and put back in to working condition, now serving as a fair robot being consistently demonstrated at fairs and outreach events.
