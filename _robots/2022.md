After 2 seasons of no competitions and no in person meetings, We finally had a full and proper season, and the result of that season was, well we havent figured it out yet... 

Yup thats right, We havent figured it out yet
We got to our first competition and hadnt named the robot yet, the announcer went to announce us and when there was nothing there he said, "...We havent figured it out yet" and that stuck!
