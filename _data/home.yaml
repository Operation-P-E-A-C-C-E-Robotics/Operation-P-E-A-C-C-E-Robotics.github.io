  content: Operation P.E.A.C.C.E. Robotics was founded in 2010 by four friends who were interested in FIRST Robotics at the high school level. Each founder came from a different High School, and as none of their schools offered an FRC program, they decided to approach Litchfield County 4-H to create their own, independent, FRC team.
