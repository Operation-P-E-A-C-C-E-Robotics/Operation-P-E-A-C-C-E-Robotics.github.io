      We have been with 4-H since the beginning of our team. We made this
      decision to work with them so that we would be able to be non-affiliated
      with a school of any kind (allowing a diverse environment for both
      students attending high school and homeschoolers). They provide us with
      helpful resources and help with our travel expenses and FIRST entrance
      fees.

      AGR is our closest sponsor. In 2015, our team stayed at several different
      locations as we struggled to find somewhere permanent, eventually, we
      found the Arthur G. Russell Company. AGR allows us to use their loft that
      overlooks the factory floor. They have supported us in several different
      ways, such as allowing us to use their machinery on the shop floor and
      having access to many tools and parts, providing us with financial aid
      annually, featuring us at their holiday luncheons, and with employee
      mentors who are willing to help our team grow and learn.
