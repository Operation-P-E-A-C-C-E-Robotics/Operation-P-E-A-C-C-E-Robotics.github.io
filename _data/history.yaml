#Content for the History page, each Timeline entry is an individual element with a Header, content and image property
#If no image is desired leave it blank
#A header should be something like "Fall 2022 - Harwington Fair" or something like that
#Content should be 3 or 4 short sentences about said thing adding a bit more info
#Postition take left or right and put the box on that side of the timeline bar, on small screens all boxes are put on the right
#Images are hidden on smaller screens, do not make your text reliant on the image to make sense
