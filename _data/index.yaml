  content: Operation P.E.A.C.C.E. (Practicing Engineering and Cooperative Competitive Excellence) Robotics was established in 2010 to excite students to pursue STEAM through competitive robotics in Bristol, Connecticut. Our team is a community team, meaning that we are not tied with any school system, being financially independent with the help of 4-H. Furthermore, we accept anyone regardless of background and skill level to join our team so they can learn the nessecary skills to become the next generation of innovators.
