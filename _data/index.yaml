    content: >
      Operation P.E.A.C.C.E. (Practicing Engineering and Cooperative Competitive
      Excellence) Robotics was established in 2010 to excite students to pursue
      STEAM through competitive robotics in Bristol, Connecticut. We are a 4-H
      community team meaning we can accept students from any school or
      home-school. Furthermore, we allow anyone regardless of background and
      skill level to join our team so they can learn the nessecary skills to
      become the next generation of innovators.

      *FIRST* (For the Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is
      an organization created to inspire kids to get involved in STEM. There are
      several different programs in FIRST, each catering to a different age
      group; FIRST Lego League Jr. (K-grade 4), FIRST Lego League (4-8), FIRST
      Tech Challenge (7-12), and FIRST Robotics Competition (9-12). Our team is
      part of the FIRST Robotics Competition (or FRC).
