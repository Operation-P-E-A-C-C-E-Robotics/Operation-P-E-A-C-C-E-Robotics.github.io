      Who are We?
    content: >
      Operation P.E.A.C.C.E. (Practicing Engineering and Cooperative Competitive
      Excellence) Robotics was established in 2010 to excite students to pursue
      STEAM through competitive robotics in Bristol, Connecticut. We are a 4-H
      community team meaning we can accept students from any school or
      home-school. Furthermore, we allow anyone regardless of background and
      skill level to join our team so they can learn the necessary skills to
      become the next generation of innovators.

      What is 4-H
    content: >
      4‑H is America’s largest youth development organization—empowering nearly
      six million young people with the skills to lead for a lifetime. 4‑H is
      delivered by Cooperative Extension—a community of more than 100 public
      universities across the nation that provides experiences where young
      people learn by doing. For more than 100 years, 4‑H has welcomed young
      people of all beliefs and backgrounds, giving kids a voice to express who
      they are and how they make their lives and communities better. Through
      life-changing 4‑H programs, nearly six million kids and teens have taken
      on critical societal issues, such as addressing community health
      inequities, engaging in civil discourse and advocating for equity and
      inclusion for all.
