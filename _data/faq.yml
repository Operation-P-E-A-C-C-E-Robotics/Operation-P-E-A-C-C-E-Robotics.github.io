  - question: WHAT DOES P.E.A.C.C.E. STAND FOR?
    answer: |
      Practicing Engineering And Competitive Cooperative Excellence!
  - question: WHAT IS A ROBOTICS TEAM?
    answer: >
      A robotics team is a dynamic group of all diverse kinds of people– from
      different locations, age-ranges, with different skills and talents, who
      have various hobbies, and even more. It’s essentially a small business,
      with several categories of tasks to do. Each robotics team is different in
      it’s own way, but they are all a family, to each other, and to *FIRST*.
      There are many things that need to get done in a robotics team, which are
      not simply putting together robots! Whatever your passion, you can get
      involved in ours, or any team.
  - question: WHAT IS FIRST?
    answer: >
      *FIRST* (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is a
      program made to get kids of any age involved in STEM (Science, Technology,
      Engineering, and Math). Each year they present teams with a new challenge
      and hold competitions for the teams to compete. The competitions involve
      completing a series of tasks to complete by the robot in both autonomous
      and teleops modes. There are different levels, starting with FLL (*FIRST*
      Lego League) for grades 4th to 8th,  FLL Jr. (*FIRST* Lego League Jr.)
      grades K to 4th, FTC (*FIRST* Tech Challenge), grades 7-12, and finally,
      our team is FRC (*FIRST* Robotics Competition) for grades 9-12.
  - question: 'AM I ELIGIBLE TO JOIN, AND HOW?'
    answer: >
      We accept a large variety of students, including both homeschoolers and
      public schoolers, ages 14-18 (but in some cases we’ve allowed younger
      students). If you’re interested, click

  - question: WHAT CAN I GET OUT OF JOINING THIS TEAM?
    answer: >
      Not only do you learn all about STEM and about running a business, but it
      looks great on a college application. [*FIRST* also offers many
      scholarships!](https://www.firstinspires.org/alumni/scholarships)
  - question: WHEN DOES THE *FIRST* BUILD SEASON START?
    answer: >
      The first Saturday in January, and it lasts for 6 weeks. Build season is
      followed by competition season which usually lasts from early March to
      late April depending on the chosen competitions and advancement.
  - question: IS THIS BATTLEBOTS?
    answer: >
      It’s something different. *FIRST* games have a series of challenges, but
      none involve purposeful destruction. It is a cooperative competition.
  - question: WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO BUILD A ROBOT?
    answer: >
      Lots of teamwork and dedication. There are many different aspects of
      building, like engineering, prototyping, machining wiring, and
      programming. Not simply just screwing nuts and bolts together!
  - question: WHEN ARE MEETINGS?
    answer: >
      During off-season (the time after competition season and before build
      season, May-December) we usually meet once or twice a week, generally
      6:30-9pm. During build and competition season, meetings pick up and it’s a
      lot more commitment. To find out more, see our calendar of events below.

  - question: WHAT IS THE TIME COMMITMENT?
    answer: >
      It depends on your position, during off-season as a student we meet twice
      a week, during build season we meet every night (day on weekends) of the
      week. Being a mentor  board member, committee chair, or team captain. The
      higher your position, the more often you need to be here. Read above for
      more information on regular (off-season) meeting schedule. Additionally,
      throughout off-season, we have several fundraising opportunities. Mainly
      in Summer, we spent a few weekends going to fairs where we display the
      robot, represent our team, and fundraise!
  - question: >-
      I'M NOT TOO INTERESTED IN TECHNICAL THINGS, CAN I STILL GET INVOLVED, AND
      HOW?
    answer: >
      Of course. Running a robotics team is similar to running a business.
      Putting together a robot is more than just mechanical design and assembly.
      Other skills are needed such as fundraising to get income and grant
      writing, and sponsor outreach. Students interested in media such as
      photography, social media, newsletter writing, and essay writing about the
      team to help win us awards like the Chairman’s Award, which is *FIRST*’s
      most prestigious award! We have even more than what’s stated here, so for
      practically any interest that you have, you will fit in here.
  - question: DOES IT COST ANYTHING TO JOIN?
    answer: |
      No, it is free to join!
  - question: WHEN/WHERE ARE COMPETITIONS
    answer: >
      Different places. Every year We are guarenteed two competitions within the
      "District", our district, the New England District, has events in all the
      New England states and we can chose any 2 of those competitions.  We like
      to chose one local one, such as Waterbury or Hartford, and one overnight
      one in a different New England state. Those 2 events determine our
      "District Ranking", if we are ranked high enough we go the District
      Championship.  The top teams from the District Championship (abbreviated
      DCMP) go to the world championship.

  - question: WHAT DOES THE ROBOT DO?
    answer: >
      All different kinds of things based, for example in 2017 the robots had to
      pick up Power Cubes (disguised milk crates) and place them on a scale and
      a switch, the robots also had to climb. The challenge changes every year
      however to give teams a new challenge every year and to prevent teams from
      reusing the same robot every year and dominating the competition.
  - question: HOW BIG IS THE ROBOT?
    answer: >
      It depends on the year, 2018 was 33 in. by 28 in. by 55 in tall and just
      under 120 lbs. They are usually around the same size.
  - question: HOW BIG ARE TEAMS?
    answer: |
      Usually anywhere between 5-50 students.
  - question: WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I AGE OUT OF THE TEAM?
    answer: >
      Students age out after highschool, usually at 18, but up to 19 in some
      cases. Don’t worry though, you can come back as a mentor at that point!
  - question: WHO ARE YOUR SPONSORS
    answer: >
      Our two main sponsors are Arthur G. Russell and 4-H. To read more, go to
