  What is the Business sub-team?
toprighttext: >
  At Operation P.E.A.C.C.E. Robotics, we believe that our work is "More Than
  Robots", as involving communication and community involvement are vital
  components of our mission. Our business sub-teams (Finance, Public Relations
  (PR), and Awards) works tirelessly to ensure that our story, achievements, and
  passion for FIRST reach far and wide. We understand that behind every
  successful robotics project lies a well-executed business strategy. Our team
  is dedicated to managing operations, cultivating partnerships, and ensuring
  the sustainability and growth of our team.


  The Business Subteam oversees the logistical and administrative aspects of our
  team, ensuring smooth operations and efficient coordination among team
  members. From scheduling meetings to managing resources, we keep the team
  running smoothly.
