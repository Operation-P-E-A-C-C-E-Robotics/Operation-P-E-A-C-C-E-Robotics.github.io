  What We Do
middlelefttext: >
  ##### Design and Prototyping


  The sub-team takes the lead in conceptualizing and creating detailed designs
  for our robots using cutting-edge CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software.
  Through prototyping, we refine our designs to ensure functionality,
  efficiency, and innovation.


  ##### Fabrication and Assembly


  From the workshop to the competition field, our team is hands-on in
  fabricating and assembling the mechanical components of our robots. We utilize
  various tools and techniques to bring our designs to life, ensuring precision
  and quality in every part.


  ##### Innovation and Iteration


  We thrive on innovation! Our team continuously explores new concepts,
  materials, and mechanisms, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in
  robotics. We iterate on designs to optimize performance and functionality.


  ##### Collaboration and Integration


  Close collaboration with other sub-teams is crucial. We work closely with
  electrical, programming, and other teams to seamlessly integrate mechanical
  components with electrical systems and software.


  #### Join Us


  Are you passionate about engineering, design, prototyping, or hands-on
  fabrication? Join our Mechanical, CAD, and Design sub-team and contribute your
  skills in CAD modeling, prototyping, machining, or mechanical engineering to
